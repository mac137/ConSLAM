	\details This structure contains a single data type and the frequency at which it should be produced.
	If m_frequency is 0xFFFF and the %XsCanOutputConfiguration is used for input, the device will configure
	itself to its maximum frequency for the data type. If it is 0xFFFF and reported by the device,
	the data has no maximum frequency, but is sent along with appropriate packets (e.g. packet counter)
