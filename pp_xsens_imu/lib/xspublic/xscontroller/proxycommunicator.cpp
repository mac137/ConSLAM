/*! \class ProxyCommunicator

	The ProxyCommunicator is a communicator that uses an external user defined communication channel. Any data
	to be transmitted by XDA to a device is given to the user in a callback (\a onTransmissionRequest) and it is
	up to the user how that data is transported. Data coming back from a device is inserted into the ProxyCommunicator
	by calling the \a handleReceivedData function. There can be multiple ProxyCommunicators as long as their user-provided
	channel identifiers are different.
